# sql_retail_sales
## **Objective**  
The SQL script is designed to **create, explore, clean, and analyze** a **retail sales dataset**. It performs the following tasks:
1. **Table Creation** â€“ Defines the schema for the `retail_sales` table.  
2. **Data Validation & Cleaning** â€“ Checks for missing values and removes incomplete records.  
3. **Data Exploration** â€“ Counts records, unique customers, and categories.  
4. **Business Analysis** â€“ Extracts sales insights, customer behaviors, and key performance metrics.

## **Step-by-Step Breakdown**  

### **1. Table Creation**  

```sql
drop table if exists retail_sales;
```
- Ensures the table **does not already exist** before creating a new one.  

```sql
create table retail_sales (
    transactions_id int primary key,
    sale_date date,
    sale_time time,
    customer_id int,
    gender varchar(50),
    age int,
    category varchar(15),
    quantity int,
    price_per_unit float,
    cogs float,
    total_sale float
);
```
- Creates the `retail_sales` table with key fields.  

---

### **2. Viewing Initial Data**  

```sql
select * from retail_sales;
select * from retail_sales limit 10;
```
- Fetches all records and **first 10 records** for a quick preview.  

---

### **3. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling**  

```sql
select count(*) from retail_sales;
```
- Counts total number of records.  

```sql
select * from retail_sales
where transactions_id is null
    or sale_date is null
    or sale_time is null
    or customer_id is null
    or gender is null
    or category is null
    or quantity is null
    or price_per_unit is null
    or cogs is null
    or total_sale is null;
```
- Identifies records with **missing values**.  

```sql
delete from retail_sales
where quantity is null
    or price_per_unit is null
    or cogs is null
    or total_sale is null;
```
- Removes **incomplete records**.  

---

### **4. Data Exploration**  

```sql
select count(*) from retail_sales;
```
- Re-checks **total records** after cleaning.  

```sql
select count(distinct(customer_id)) as total_customers from retail_sales;
```
- Counts **unique customers**.  

```sql
select distinct(category) as categories from retail_sales;
```
- Lists **all product categories**.

           avg(total_sale) as avg_sale,
           rank() over (partition by extract(year from sale_date)
                        order by avg(total_sale) desc) as ranked
    from retail_sales
    group by extract(month from sale_date), extract(year from sale_date)
    order by extract(year from sale_date), avg_sale desc
) dup
where ranked = 1;
```
- Identifies **the month with the highest average sales for each year**.  

#### **h) Top 5 Customers by Total Sales**  
```sql
select customer_id, sum(total_sale)
from retail_sales

#### **j) Grouping Sales into Time-Based Shifts**  
```sql
with hourly_sale as (

               when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17 then 'Afternoon'
               else 'Evening'
           end as shift
    from retail_sales
)
select shift, count(*)
from hourly_sale
group by shift;
